# Debian Almquist Shell (Dash)

While Bash is very popular (and so is its syntax), Dash replaced Bash as non-interactive shell in 2011 with the release of Debian 6 (Squeeze). Dash is POSIX-compliant, small and fast. For the interactive shell Bash is still used – which is absolutely fine.

However, Bash is not POSIX-compliant which can be a portability problem, especially when shared with the open-source community. Instead of memorizing different syntaxes and features between different shells – which can be dangerously confusing – I decided to use exactly **one** shell. Since Dash is POSIX-compliant, the choice was clear and I stopped writing shell scripts in Bash.
