# Setup WinSCP

WinSCP can be used for live editing, uploading and downloading files using an encrypted SSH/SFTP connection. SFTP is part of OpenSSH and easy to setup. Don't use FTP or SCP â€“ both is either insecure or outdated.

You can download WinSCP [here](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

## Settings

Before you can work with WinSCP, there are many important settings you need to change.

After installation, choose **Options > Preferences** and make sure, that you use **English** as language and restart WinSCP:

Now, make sure all of these settings are applied:

Add an editor, usually Notepad++ (can be downloaded [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)):
